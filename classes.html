    <p>This 90 minute class features very slow movement and long poses that are supported by a chair or

    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
    <p>Prepare yourself for Savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your palms up.
    Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries
    slip away. When you are ready roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself
    to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be
    grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
